Introduction
Data analysis is an essential task in various fields, including business, research, and data science. The ability to process, analyze, and visualize data efficiently is crucial for making informed decisions. One of the key aspects of data analysis is the ability to generate reports that summarize important findings. Reports allow users to understand patterns, trends, and key statistics without going through raw data.
In this project, we develop a Python script that reads data from a file, analyzes it, and generates a formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. The script is designed to handle CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, extract numerical data, perform basic statistical analysis, and generate a well-structured PDF report containing the analyzed results.
This script is useful for data analysts, researchers, and business professionals who want to quickly analyze data and generate reports without requiring complex software. It automates the process of extracting insights from structured datasets and presents them in a readable and printable format.

Libraries Used
The script uses the following Python libraries:

1)Pandas – A powerful library used for handling and analyzing data. It allows easy data manipulation and supports CSV file reading.

2)Statistics – A built-in Python module used for computing basic statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.

3)FPDF – A library for creating PDF files in Python. It allows formatting and structuring of content in a professional-looking document.

How the Script Works
The script follows a step-by-step approach:

1)Reading Data from a File:

*)The script reads data from a CSV file using the pandas library.

*)It ensures that the file is loaded properly and handles any errors if the file is missing or corrupted.

2)Performing Data Analysis:

*)The script selects numerical columns from the dataset.

*)It computes basic statistical measures for each numerical column:

  i) Mean (Average value of the dataset)

  ii)Median (Middle value in sorted data)

  iii) Standard Deviation (Measure of data spread)

*)If a column has missing values, the script automatically handles them.

3)Generating a PDF Report:

*)A formatted PDF document is created using the FPDF library.

*)The title, column names, and computed statistics are written to the PDF.

*)The report follows a clean and structured layout with proper spacing and alignment.

*)The final PDF file is saved and can be shared or printed.
